## Plugins vs Integrations
Since integrations are managed by xyd, their versions and compatibility are handled automatically, ensuring a seamless experience without requiring manual updates or configuration.

While integrations are easy to use it has drawbacks also, such as limited customization options, dependency on xyd's update schedule, and potential delays in accessing new features compared to plugins.
Plugins are community-driven also.
