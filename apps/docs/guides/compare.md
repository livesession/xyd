## Summary
We build xyd to scale in mind. At [LiveSession](https://livesession.io) we need robust options to generate our docs from multiple sources like OpenAPI, GraphQL, CLI, code and much more. We take care of UX seriously too. We're obsessed about that. 

For us, it's not only a docs framework, it's something more. We are on the road to build the best [developer platform](https://livesession.dev) for product analytics. If you need a scalable and true Open Source solution, xyd is for you.
[Read a story](https://blog.livesession.dev/why-another-yet-docs-framework) about that.
