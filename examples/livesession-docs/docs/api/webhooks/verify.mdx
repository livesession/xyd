# Verify
<Subtitle>
    Learn how to verify the authenticity of LiveSession webhook requests.
</Subtitle>

## Quickstart
Before you proceed with responding to a webhook, it's crucial to ensure that the webhook originated from LiveSession.
This verification can be accomplished by calculating a digital signature.

Every webhook request incorporates a base64-encoded HMAC-SHA256 signature included in `LiveSession-Signature` header.
This header is created using the webhook's secret in conjunction with the data transmitted in the request.

To compute the HMAC digest, follow below written algorithm:

        ```js
        import crypto from 'crypto';

        // Your webhook secret key
        const secretKey = 'your_secret_key_here';

        // Received data from the webhook payload
        const receivedData = 'received_data_here';

        // Received base64-encoded HMAC signature from the webhook headers
        const receivedSignatureBase64 = 'received_signature_here'; // Replace with actual received signature

        // Function to compute HMAC-SHA256 signature and return base64-encoded result
        function computeHmacSha256Base64(data, secretKey) {
            const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secretKey);
            hmac.update(data);

            return hmac.digest('base64');
        }

        // Calculate the base64-encoded HMAC-SHA256 signature for the received data
        const calculatedSignatureBase64 = computeHmacSha256Base64(receivedData, secretKey);

        // Compare the received signature with the calculated signature
        if (receivedSignatureBase64 === calculatedSignatureBase64) {
            console.log('Webhook signature is valid. Request is authentic.');
        } else {
            console.log('Webhook signature is invalid. Request might be tampered.');
        }
        ```
